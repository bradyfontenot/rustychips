# Rusty Chips: A Chip8 Emulator in Rust

## Motivations
My attempt to learn Rust doing something fun. Surely not idiomatic Rust and probably a little dirty bit. certainly is serving its purpose. Also has the added benefit of being exposed to dealing with registers, bitwise ops, and some assembly-ish instructions.

## What is Chip8?
CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers.
